### Hi there, welcome! 

Nice to meet you :) 

Here are some programming projects I've worked on as part of my learning journey. 

You can also find other parts of me here:

- [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/tomasproano)
- [Music for short documentary *Hijas del viento Wayra apamushkas*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2Zx_ZJ9HQEs), directed by Cristina Vera Vega and Magali Marega 
- Photography and poetry project with Estefan√≠a Montenegro: [*hacerse piel*](https://tomasproanop.github.io/hacerse-piel)

And this ist some FOSS I find very useful:

- [Syncthing](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing) -  File synchronization tool
- [BorgBackup](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg) - Deduplicated, compressed and encrypted backups
- [LZ4](https://github.com/lz4/lz4) -  Extremely fast compression
- [Anki](https://github.com/ankitects/anki) - A tool for learning through spaced repetition

Here are statistics of all my repositories:
