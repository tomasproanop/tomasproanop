### Hi there, welcome! 

Nice to meet you :) 

Here are some programming projects I've worked on as part of my learning journey. 

You can also find other parts of me here: 

- [Bandcamp](https://tomasproano.bandcamp.com)
- [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/tomasproano)
- Incidental music for the short documentary [*Hijas del viento Wayra apamushkas*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2Zx_ZJ9HQEs), directed by [Cristina Vera Vega](https://flacsoandes.academia.edu/CristinaVeraVega) and [Magali Marega](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=butmn-sAAAAJ&hl=es) 
- Photography and poetry project with [Estefan√≠a Montenegro Ayala](https://www.figma.com/proto/54HyzeOtliXnQjt5h30ycf/Estefania-Montenegro-Portfolio?page-id=0%3A1&type=design&node-id=11747-210&viewport=-1424%2C638%2C0.4&t=T6Df81G9cJ98NOJz-1&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=1%3A6): [*hacerse piel*](https://estefaniamontenegro.visura.co/hacersepiel)

These are some FOSS I find very useful:

- [Syncthing](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing) -  This is a handy file synchronization tool.
- [BorgBackup](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg) - This tool creates deduplicated, compressed and encrypted backups.
- [LZ4](https://github.com/lz4/lz4) -  This software is able to deliver extremely fast compression.
- [Anki](https://github.com/ankitects/anki) - This a great tool for learning through spaced repetition
- [TestDisk](https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk) - A powerful life-saving free data recovery software. It is able to recover lost partitions and/or make non-booting disks bootable again.
- [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/) - This is a tool for converting video from nearly any format to a selection of modern, widely supported codecs. One can also do small edits such as change length, add filters, add subtitles, and many others.

And here are programming language statistics of all my public repositories:

[![Top Languages](https://github-readme-stats-git-masterrstaa-rickstaa.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=tomasproanop&show_icons=true&theme=transparent)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

This tool was developed by [Anurag Hazra](https://github.com/anuraghazra).
