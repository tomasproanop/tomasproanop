### Hi there, welcome! 

Nice to meet you :) 

Here are some programming projects I've worked on as part of my learning journey. 

You can also find other parts of me here: 

- [Bandcamp](https://tomasproano.bandcamp.com)
- [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/tomasproano)
- Music for short documentary [*Hijas del viento Wayra apamushkas*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2Zx_ZJ9HQEs), directed by Cristina Vera Vega and Magali Marega 
- Photography and poetry project with Estefan√≠a Montenegro: [*hacerse piel*](https://tomasproanop.github.io/hacerse-piel)

And this ist some FOSS I find very useful:

- [Syncthing](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing) -  This is a handy file synchronization tool.
- [BorgBackup](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg) - This tool creates deduplicated, compressed and encrypted backups.
- [LZ4](https://github.com/lz4/lz4) -  This software is able to deliver extremely fast compression.
- [Anki](https://github.com/ankitects/anki) - This a great tool for learning through spaced repetition
- [TestDisk](https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk) - A powerful life-saving free data recovery software. It is able to recover lost partitions and/or make non-booting disks bootable again.
- [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/) - This is a tool for converting video from nearly any format to a selection of modern, widely supported codecs. One can also do small edits (change duration, add filters, add subtitles).

Here are statistics of all my repositories:

[![Top Languages](https://github-readme-stats-git-masterrstaa-rickstaa.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=tomasproanop&show_icons=true&theme=transparent)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

This tool was developed by [Anurag Hazra](https://github.com/anuraghazra).
