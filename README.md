### Hi there, welcome! 

Nice to meet you :) 

Here are some programming projects I've worked on as part of my learning journey. 

You can also find other parts of me here: 

- [Bandcamp](https://tomasproano.bandcamp.com)
- [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/tomasproano)
- Incidental music for the short documentary [*Hijas del viento / Wayra apamushkas*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2Zx_ZJ9HQEs), directed by [Cristina Vera Vega](https://flacsoandes.academia.edu/CristinaVeraVega) and [Magali Marega](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=butmn-sAAAAJ&hl=es). You can also find out more about their work and research [here](https://www.academia.edu/43418488/Hijas_del_viento_Wayra_apamushkas_Historia_de_vida_de_mujeres_entregadas_de_ni%C3%B1as_para_el_trabajo_del_hogar_en_los_Andes_ecuatorianos_Ciudad_Aut%C3%B3noma_de_Buenos_Aires_Editorial_Antropofagia).
- Photography and poetry project [*hacerse piel*](https://estefaniamontenegro.visura.co/hacersepiel) with photographer and UI/UX designer [Estefan√≠a Montenegro Ayala](https://www.figma.com/proto/54HyzeOtliXnQjt5h30ycf/Estefania-Montenegro-Portfolio?page-id=0%3A1&type=design&node-id=11747-210&viewport=-1424%2C638%2C0.4&t=T6Df81G9cJ98NOJz-1&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=1%3A6)

And these are some FOSS I find very useful:

- [Disk Inventory X](http://www.derlien.com/) - This is a disk usage utility for Mac OS X. It shows the sizes of files and folders in a special graphical way called "treemaps". 
- [Syncthing](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing) - This is a handy file synchronization tool.
- [BorgBackup](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg) - This tool creates deduplicated, compressed and encrypted backups.
- [LZ4](https://github.com/lz4/lz4) -  This software is able to deliver extremely fast compression.
- [Anki](https://github.com/ankitects/anki) - This a great tool for learning through spaced repetition
- [TestDisk](https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk) - A powerful life-saving free data recovery software. It is able to recover lost partitions and/or make non-booting disks bootable again.
- [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/) - This is a tool for converting video from nearly any format to a selection of modern, widely supported codecs. One can also do small edits such as change length, add filters, add subtitles, etc.
- [OpenShot Video Editor](https://www.openshot.org/) - A great alternative to other video editing software I used in the past.
